# Swapcard Test

Welcome to the repository for my Swapcard test

Simply clone the git repo and run **npm install** or **yarn** and then **npm start** or **yarn start** to run the project in the browser.

This repo was left as public to allow you to review the code

I took the opportunity of this test to experiment on some of React's new features such as **Hooks**.

This was also my first time working with **GraphQL** and its eco-system from which I opted to use **Apollo** and more.

I chose to use LocalStorage in order to store the user's favourite Artists. 

## Enjoy!
